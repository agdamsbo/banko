Below, you should be able to generate banko cards.

Errors, I think due to the file export location.

```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 600
library(shiny)
library(bslib)

project.aid::merge_scripts(
  files = c(
    list.files("R/", pattern = ".R$", full.names = TRUE),
    "app/server_raw.R"
  ),
  dest = here::here("app/server.R")
)

source(here::here("app/ui.R"))
source(here::here("app/server.R"))


# Create Shiny app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
